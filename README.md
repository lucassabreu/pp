PP (Podcast Player)
===================

This is a experiment to create a PWA Podcast Player using Firebase as a database for user settings.

The expected features are these:

 * [ ] Import RSS into the shared database for catalog
 * [ ] Keep a list of the RSS that the users are subscribed.
 * [ ] A simple auto player for the episodes.
 * [ ] Control each episodes were listen or not by the user.
 * [ ] Allow to mark episodes as listened or not listened in batch.
 * [ ] On PWA mode allow the user to pre-download episodes.
